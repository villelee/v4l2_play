This is just for learning V4L2 framework

Developer:

-About files:
   --template directory includes source file and Makefile template.
     And the only header file is in src/include.
   --kern_mode_need directory contains the kernel modules needed by vivi.
     To install them just get the root privilege and run kern_mode_need/built_modes/prepare.sh






Good Luck!
